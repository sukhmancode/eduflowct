## 💡 Idea

In today’s education system, teachers often struggle with repetitive tasks like grading and giving feedback, while students lack personalized support. Our platform solves this by introducing an AI-powered teacher assistant that:

- Automatically grades student submissions using Google Gemini AI
- Generates personalized feedback reports to help students improve
- Allows teachers to create custom quizzes by selecting the topic, difficulty, and number of questions
- Enables students to take quizzes in multiple languages with timers and fullscreen enforcement to ensure fairness
- Brings everything into a centralized dashboard for colleges, teachers, and students to interact efficiently
